DESCRIPTION
===========
This dataset includes recordings for a patient that was not reported in the 
above articles, but are part of the same study. The patient presents a focal
epilepsy of the left temporo-occipital junction, MRI-negative, and was implanted 
in the surrounding areas.
The subfolder "seeg" contains the recordings of three seizures, all of them 
showing a propagation of high-frequency oscillations from the lesion towards 
the temporal lobe, bilaterally.
